# Feature Extraction and Selection

## Feature Extraction

The file XX performs the feature extraction using the processing methods in the resitories: .

## Feature Selection

After the features are extracted and the wind velocity field is estimated the files are save in a directory. This files are loaded and processed again to select the pixels that will more likely intercept the Sun. The itersecting probabilies are used to weighted the stastistics computed for each features in file .py.

## Dataset

A sample dataset is publicaly available in DRYAD repository: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi%253A10.5061%252Fdryad.zcrjdfn9m
